/**
 * New level
 * ---------
 * Description
 * Some players need a challenge, so let's make the secret code in the game harder to guess. You should add support for
 * more than 10 symbols by including letters too. Now, the secret code can contain the 10 numbers 0-9 and the 26
 * lowercase Latin characters a-z. So, the new maximum length for the secret code is 36.
 * You should also implement a system where users can select the number of possible symbols that can be used to create
 * the secret code. So you should request input twice: once for the secret code length and once for the number of
 * possible symbols in it. Note that the length of the secret code may not match the number of possible symbols in it.
 * Therefore, it is important to verify that the secret code length is not greater than the number of possible symbols
 * as the integers in secret code have to be unique.
 * Also, since the secret code is not a number anymore, allow the symbol 0 as the first character in a secret code.
 * ---------
 * Objectives
 * In this step, your program should:
 * 1. Ask for the length of the secret code.
 * 2. Ask for the range of possible symbols in the secret code.
 * 3. Generate a secret code using numbers and characters. This time, you should also print the secret code using *
 *    characters and print which symbols were used to generate the secret code.
 * 4. Function as a fully playable game.
