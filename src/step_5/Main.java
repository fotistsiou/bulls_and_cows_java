/**
 * Improve the code generator
 * --------------------------
 * Description
 * The algorithm suggested for generating the secret code in the previous stage was really a “reinvention of the wheel”.
 * Java already has the tools for generating random numbers! Research some common pseudo-random generation methods, such
 * as Math.random() and other methods from the Random class. Choose the method you like and use it to rewrite the secret
 * code generation. To learn more about the Random class, jump to Random topic. If you want to get to know all the
 * intricacies of the Math library, don't forget to check out the Math library topic as well.
 * Nothing else is supposed to change at this stage: the program asks for the length, generates a secret code, and then
 * receives and grades the attempts until the code is guessed. Your task here is to rewrite the code generator without
 * breaking the existing code.
 * --------------------------
 * Objective
 * In this stage, rewrite the secret code generator using a suitable Java method.
