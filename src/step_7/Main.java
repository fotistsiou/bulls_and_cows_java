/**
 * Error!
 * ------
 * Description
 * There are many possibilities for errors. What if someone enters an answer of the wrong length? Or if the number of
 * possible symbols is less than the length of the code? What if the answer contains invalid symbols? The game may crash
 * before the secret number is guessed!
 * Let's handle errors like this. At this point, you can implement this without the try-catch construction. Use the
 * following rule of thumb: if you can avoid exception-based logic, do so! If you use exceptions in normal situations,
 * how would you deal with unusual (exceptional) situations? Now it may not seem that important, but when you need to
 * find errors in more complex programs, this makes a difference.
 * ------
 * Objectives
 * In this stage, your program should:
 * 1. Handle incorrect input.
 * 2. Print an error message that contains the word error. After that, don't ask for the numbers again, just finish the
 *    program.
